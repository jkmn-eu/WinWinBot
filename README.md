# WinWinBot

WinWinBot is a personal project that I'll use to learn how Twitter API (v2).

It needs to :

1/ be able to collect tweets for contests.
2/ build some Ruby objects based on it and store them in a DB (maybe for later use/analysis).
3/ sort those tweets and determine which need to be answered to, and how.
4/ answer the said tweets in an appropriate manner.
5/ make me win TONS of prizes, of course. (to be perfectly honest, I could care less about this specific point. I just want to build something that works and have some fun doing it)
